# train_timetable
<p>I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.</p>
<p>Technologies: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Moment.js, Firebase</p>
